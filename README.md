# H3ML - Hyper 3D Markup Language

Html with css has been the latest driving force in the democratization of information. However the unsung hero is the unseen html layout engine. Prior to a layout engine, content creation was a laborious task. A content creator utilized a page layout tool like Adobe PageMaker. PageMaker helped with kerning, flowing text around imagines, formatting and indenting, and would result in a rasterized image, which could be distributed.

Hyper 3D markup language, or h3ml, extends content from 2D to 3D processing, with all the same html and css syntax. 

H3ml has no focus on 3D model generation. Similar to referencing images, model are represented in a single element with attributes to describe them. An asset provider translates attribute values to a 3D model with its textures and properties.

For example if you representing a car:
```
<obj abc:cref="car" make="ford" doors="4" color="red" />
```
